# AI Electoral Integrity Face Recognition Voting System

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a face recognition-based voting system to ensure electoral integrity. The system leverages artificial intelligence to authenticate voters and prevent fraudulent activities.

## Features
- **Face Recognition**: Uses AI to verify voter identity.
- **Secure Voting**: Ensures that each vote is cast by a legitimate voter.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy to use for both voters and administrators.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Quick and efficient voter verification.
